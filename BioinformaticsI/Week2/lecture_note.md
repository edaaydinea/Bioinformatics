# Where in the Genome Does RNA Replication Begin? (Part 3)

- **DNA Strand Directions**
    - DNA strands have directions.
    - Two DNA strands run in opposite directions (blue strand: clockwise, green strand: counterclockwise).
- **DNA Polymerase**
    - DNA polymerases are unidirectional.
    - They can only copy DNA in the direction opposite to DNA's direction.
- **Replication Problem**
    - Recruiting four DNA polymerases won't work due to their unidirectional nature.
    - Only two of the four polymerases can move in the correct direction.
- **Half-Strands Classification**
    - Reverse half-strand (blue): No problem replicating; moves from origin to terminus.
    - Thick green line: No problem replicating.
    - The other two half-strands: Cannot replicate in the same direction they go.
- **Replication Process**
    - Fork enlargement allows replication to start.
    - Multiple DNA polymerases are needed due to the unidirectional constraint.
    - Okazaki fragments are formed during this process.
    - Post-replication: Repair gaps between Okazaki fragments.
- **Strand Lifestyles**
    - Reverse half-strand: Lives mostly double-stranded.
    - Forward half-strands: Spend a large portion single-stranded, awaiting fork opening.
- **Mutation Rates**
    - Single-stranded DNA has a higher mutation rate than double-stranded DNA.
    - Cytosine (C) rapidly mutates into Thymine (T).
    - Forward half-strands: Shortage of C, normal G.
    - Reverse half-strands: Shortage of G, normal C.
- **Algorithmic Implication**
    - Walking along the genome and counting #G - #C:
        - Decreasing #G - #C indicates moving along a strand with high C and low G.
        - Increasing #G - #C indicates moving along a strand with low C and high G.
    - Transition from decreasing to increasing #G - #C signals passing the origin of replication.

- **Definition of Skew(k)**
    - Skew(k) = Number of G - Number of C in the first k nucleotides of the genome.
- **Skew Diagram**
    - A plot of Skew(k) against k.
    - Used to identify the origin of replication in a genome.
- **E. Coli Skew Diagram**
    - The origin of replication is at the point where the skew diagram transitions from decreasing to increasing.
- **Frequent Words Problem**
    - Attempt to find frequent sequences (k-mers) in the replication origin.
    - Initial attempts failed to find frequent k-mers appearing even three times.
- **Challenges in Finding Frequent Words**
    - The origin of replication derived from the skew diagram may not be precise.
    - Hidden messages initiating replication might be more subtle than expected.
- **Replication Origin in Vibrio Cholerae**
    - Six 9-mers were initially found in the region.
    - Additional attention revealed two more 9-mers differing by a single nucleotide.
- **DNA Boxes**
    - DNA can bind to perfect 9-mers as well as variations with single nucleotide differences.
    - This necessitates solving the "Frequent Words with Mismatches" problem.
- **Frequent Words with Mismatches Problem**
    - Input: A string (text), integers k (length of k-mers), and d (number of mismatches).
    - Goal: Find all most frequent k-mers with up to d mismatches in the text.
- **Successful Identification in E. Coli**
    - Running the frequent words with mismatches problem found elusive frequent k-mers.
    - These k-mers were identified as real DNA boxes in E. Coli.
- **Practical Considerations**
    - Some bacteria have fewer DNA boxes, making the algorithm less effective.
    - The terminus of replication is not always directly opposite the origin.
    - Skew diagrams can be more complex than in the case of E. Coli.
